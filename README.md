## Summary

5 Stars review rates between paid and non-paid reviews are almost identical. Therefore we cannot say that there is positivity bias for in this particular outdoor product.
However outdoor products customer's behaviour can be different than other products. It is always better to do same analysis with other products data. \
According the our dataset, number of paid reviews are 107 and non-paid reviews are 39869. This is a huge difference. In order to support our result, we might want to increase the number of vine customer reviews.
